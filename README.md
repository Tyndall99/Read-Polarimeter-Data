# Read-Polarimeter-Data
A simple code in Python that make a data treatment of the polarimeter PAX5710VIS-T-TXP (Thorlabs, inc) measurements.
Here we calculate the mean and deviation of the stokes parameters and the degree of polarization.
The graphics of the code made a graph of the depolarization process of partially coherent light passing through a rotating retarder biplate and we made a graphic of this process in the poincar√© Spehere.
